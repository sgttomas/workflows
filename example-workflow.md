# Example Workflow: Feature Development with AI Pairing

## Intent
Provide a repeatable flow for scoping, implementing, and validating a feature with AI assistance.

## Steps
1. Define scope and success criteria in `docs/adr/`.
2. Draft prompts in `prompts/` for planning, coding, and tests.
3. Create or select a project in `projects/<name>`.
4. Implement incrementally; commit locally in the child repo.
5. Review outputs and update docs/workflows as needed.
6. Open a PR in the child repo; capture notes back in `docs/`.
